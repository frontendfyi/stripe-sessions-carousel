# Recreating Stripe's Amazingly Detailed Carousel With Tailwind

Last week Stripe released their new [Stripe Sessions](https://stripe.com/sessions) website, full of amazing details.
One of the things that stood out was their speakers carousel. A carousel that has lot's of nice small animations and feels like a breeze to use.

In this video we'll be recreating this carousel with Tailwind CSS. We'll be mainly focussing on the animations and styling part. The JavaScript part is kept to a minimum.
